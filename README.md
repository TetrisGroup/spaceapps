NASA SpaceApps Challenge

https://2014.spaceappschallenge.org/project/tetris-expedionally-technologically-radical-instrumental-suit/

We aim to design a suit, that monitors the astronaut's physical state and environment and supports him in accomplishing his tasks. As of now the suit integrates finger probes, a heartbeat/pulse sensor and a helmet mounted camera, that are connected to and managed by a central unit - a RaspberryPi.

The RaspberryPI will also be the uplink to mission ops to transmit astronaut's status as well as instructions and information to the astronaut to support his mission.

for the videostreaming hud background we found this resource very helpful:
