NASA SpaceApps Challenge

https://2014.spaceappschallenge.org/challenge/space-wearables-fashion-designer-astronauts/

We aim to design a suit, that monitors the astronaut's physical state and environment and supports him in accomplishing his tasks. As of now the suit integrates finger probes, a heartbeat/pulse sensor and a helmet mounted camera, that are connected to and managed by a central unit - a RaspberryPi.

The RaspberryPI will also be the uplink to mission ops to transmit astronaut's status as well as instructions and information to the astronaut to support his mission.
